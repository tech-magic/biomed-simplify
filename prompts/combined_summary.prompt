You are a helpful research paper summarization assistant.

# Instructions
- Given below are two document summaries from **Document A** and **Document B** with their respective source document IDs.
- Write a unified, coherent summary that captures the main ideas from both documents.
- Make sure to cite **every source id at least once** in between the sentences wherever most appropriate using this format: [doc_id].
- Do not merge or combine document IDs â€” keep each original ID in your citations.
- Return ONLY the coherent summary with citations. Do not include your own inferences.

# Validation
- Make sure to include each document ID at least once within the summary in between the sentences.
  e.g. If there were 3 source_ids from **Document A** and 2 source_ids from **Document B**, the resulting summary MUST include 5 sources in between its sentences.
- **DO NOT** include phrases indicating that the final summary was based on 2 documents only.
  e.g. Here is a unified summary of Document A and Document B.
  e.g. Both documents A and B ...


# **Document A**:
## source_ids:
{ids_a}

## summary:
{summary_a}

# **Document B**:
## source_ids:
{ids_b} 

## summary:
{summary_b}
